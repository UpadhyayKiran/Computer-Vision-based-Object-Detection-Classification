# Object Detection using Deep Learning

## Introduction
This project aims to develop an object detection model using deep learning to detect and classify objects within images. It uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based architecture and is trained on a custom dataset.

The objective is to create a robust model capable of accurately identifying objects in real-world images, making it suitable for applications like automated surveillance, robotics, and image search.

## Mathematical Formulation

### 1. Object Detection Model
The model architecture is based on a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**, with the following key components:

- **Convolution Layers:** Extracts features such as edges, textures, and shapes from input images.
  
- **Activation Function (ReLU):** Introduces non-linearity to the model.
  
- **Pooling Layers:** Reduces spatial dimensions while maintaining important information.

- **Fully Connected Layers:** Converts extracted features into class probabilities.

The model uses **bounding box regression** to predict the locations of objects and **softmax activation** for classification.

### 2. Loss Function
The model uses a combination of **classification loss** and **bounding box regression loss**:

- **Classification Loss:** Measures the accuracy of object class predictions.
  $$
  L_{\text{class}} = -\sum_{i} y_i \log(p_i)
  $$
  where:
  - \( y_i \) = Ground truth label (1 for correct class, 0 otherwise)
  - \( p_i \) = Predicted probability for class \( i \)

- **Bounding Box Loss:** Measures the difference between predicted and actual bounding box coordinates.
  $$
  L_{\text{bbox}} = \sum_{i} \left| \hat{x}_i - x_i \right| + \left| \hat{y}_i - y_i \right| + \left| \hat{w}_i - w_i \right| + \left| \hat{h}_i - h_i \right|
  $$
  where:
  - \( \hat{x}, \hat{y}, \hat{w}, \hat{h} \) = Predicted bounding box coordinates
  - \( x, y, w, h \) = Ground truth bounding box coordinates

The final **loss function** combines these two components:
$$
L = L_{\text{class}} + \lambda \cdot L_{\text{bbox}}
$$
where \( \lambda \) is a hyperparameter controlling the balance between classification and bounding box loss.

### 3. Training Process
The training process follows the **gradient descent** optimization algorithm, adjusting weights and biases in the network to minimize the loss function.

### 4. Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using metrics such as:
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Measures the precision at different recall levels.
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measures the overlap between predicted and actual bounding boxes.

## Implementation Overview
1. **Data Preprocessing:** 
   - Load and preprocess the dataset of images and annotations (in JSON format).
   - Resize images and normalize pixel values.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Define the CNN-based model for object detection.
   - Use layers such as convolutional, activation (ReLU), and fully connected layers.
   - Implement object detection-specific outputs (bounding boxes and class labels).

3. **Training the Model:**
   - Use the training dataset to optimize the model using backpropagation and gradient descent.
   - Monitor loss and accuracy during training.

4. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Use a validation/test dataset to evaluate the model's performance.
   - Calculate metrics such as mAP and IoU.

5. **Inference:**
   - Perform inference on new images, predicting the objects and their locations.

## Results
The object detection model performs well on the dataset, identifying objects accurately. The loss and accuracy trends over the training epochs are visualized.
